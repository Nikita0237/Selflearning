        <p>LINUX THORVALDS is the creater of LINUX. In simple words LINUS THORVALDS created LINUX because he did't have money to buy UNIX.He was a student at the university of Helsinki.In 1991 he decided to do a project on UNIX but free version of UNIX were too old and other commercial are too costly.So he thought of creating his own OS.Now one question may arise that is LINUX an exact copy of UNIX?Actually not let us clear this for you.For idea purpose, LINUS did research on UNIX,but more than UNIX he did not research on MINIX OS.LINUX is not an extra copy of UNIX.
